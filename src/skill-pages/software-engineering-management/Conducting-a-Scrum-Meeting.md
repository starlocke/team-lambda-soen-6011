The daily Scrum meeting, also known as the daily stand-up, is the daily meeting where your software development team gathers to provide project status updates about what has been done, what needs to be done, and where there are issues.

## Rationale for Skill  
- **Keep the meetings on targe**  
The first step towards an effective Scrum meeting is making sure that the meeting stays on target. In order to do this, the only subjects that should come up during this time are what each individual team member is working on as well as the issues they’re struggling with.

- **Meetings should not be about problem-solving**  
One important thing to note is that for the daily Scrum meetings to be effective, problems can’t be solved during the meetings. While the third question brings issues to the forefront, these issues may not affect the whole team. As a result, spending an excessive amount of time discussing these issues with everyone is not a productive use of team time.

- **Team members should be prepared ahead of time**  
As mentioned in the discussion of the three questions, your team members should be able to answer those questions without your prompting. In order for this to happen, you must outline what you expect to hear from your team every day. Once you set those expectations, your team members should come prepared with answers on a daily basis.

- **Make the meetings short**  
Daily Scrums that run too long aren’t effective. People get distracted, stop listening, and ramble on for far too long. Your team then begins to resent these meetings, and communication breaks down. That’s why limiting your meeting time is so important. The shorter they are, the more likely people are to pay attention and find them necessary.

- **Stand Up Meetings**  
Some believe that, by forcing everyone to stand during the daily Scrum meeting, the meeting is more likely to stay on target and on time. And let’s be honest, the reasoning is solid. No one wants to stand around for an hour just talking.

- **Make sure the meetings are daily**  
When you’re running daily Scrum meetings, make sure that they’re just that – daily. This is important for consistent communication between team members about what is and isn’t being accomplished.

## Roles for Skill
- **Product Owner**: The person with the product vision
- **Scrum Master**: The scrum expert who helps the team build the product according to the scrum framework
- **Development Team**: The team members who execute the work

## Work Related to Skill
- **Scrum Master**  
A scrum master is a facilitator for an Agile development team; they are responsible for managing the exchange of information between team members. Scrum is a methodology that allows a team to self-organize and make changes quickly, in accordance with Agile principles.

- **Agile Coach**  
Agile coaches help train corporate teams on the agile methodology and oversee the development of agile teams to ensure effective outcomes for the organization. They are responsible for guiding teams through the implementation process and are tasked with encouraging workers and leadership to embrace the agile method. The agile coach’s ultimate goal is to arm agile teams with the right knowledge, tools and training so that they’ll be able to use agile to its full potential.

## Role of Industry in Cultivating the Skill
- **Survival of the fastest to market**  
It can be fastest to market only if you’re getting customer feedback up front while addressing the highest-priority features and highest risks. Higher quality is built through early testing. Scrum enables early, high-quality release to market. Sounds like a good fit for scrum. This reality is why plenty of manufacturers now employ scrum masters and agile coaches.  
New technologies are astounding: robotics, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing, and nanotechnology, to name but a few. Each of these technologies introduces new complexities to production. Scrum- and agile-based frameworks are ideal for problem-solving complexity.  

- **Shareholder value**  
Scrum and its organic feedback cycle emphasize regular customer-value feedback. After each sprint, you have working, shippable product to show to stakeholders and customers. Even if you can’t get feedback during the sprint, scrum allows you to adapt as soon as you receive the feedback.  
As stated in the Agile Manifesto, the primary measure of success is a working product in the hands of a customer — the earlier the better, and the more frequently the better. Scrum does both.

- **Strategic capacity management**   
In building tangible products, you may not have a final piece of product to place in someone’s hands at the end of a one-week sprint. This is fine. Just remember to keep the progression demonstrable and the feedback cycle as short as possible.  
The idea is to have regular, frequent feedback from users. The specifics will vary with each product. Work to keep the feedback cycle as short as possible and decrease it when possible.  

## Tools Supporting the Skill
- **monday.com**  
monday.com is great for managing scrum teams and projects. It helps teams plan their sprints in a completely customizable interface, which helps workflow creation fit the team’s needs. monday.com offers multiple views from which you can create burndown charts and analyze your work, such as kanban, timeline, files, among many others.

- **MeisterTask**  
MeisterTask is a simple, beautiful task management tool for agile teams. The web-based platform provides flexible Kanban boards to manage your backlogs and sprints. This is a great tool for companies who are just starting out with the Scrum methodology, but thanks to its built-in automation and large number of integrations with other tools, it easily scales with your needs.

- **Nutcache**
Nutcache helps you manage and track all aspects of your project using a sophisticated toolbox of color-coded schedules, task organization queues, and data reporting. You can also use their Gantt chart to visually plan and organize your tasks and then switch to a Scrum board view.

## Skill Self-Assessment
**Self-Assessment: 6/10**  
I am a computer science student, did not practice this software management skill before. Now, I read some articles about agile development to gain some basic level knowledge of Scrum meetings, and use this skill in the academic team project. However, I didn't face any real-world experience yet.  
  
I am well aware that computer science is not a reason why I can not be good at this skill. Only if I have a better understanding of software engineering, then I can better use my knowledge of computer science into work. Therefore, I will work hard to learn software management knowledge and strive to be a qualified software engineer.
