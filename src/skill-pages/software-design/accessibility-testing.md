Web accessibility testing is a subset of usability testing where the users under consideration have disabilities that affect how they use the web. The end goal, in both usability and accessibility, is to discover how easily people can use a web site and feed that information back into improving future designs and implementations.<sup>1<sup/>

The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including:

natural information such as text, images, and sounds
code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.<sup>2<sup/>

## Classification of Skill

## Prerequisites for Skill

- Good undestanding of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) given by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<sup>2<sup/>

## Related Software Engineering Area(s)
- Software design 
- Software testing

## Rationale for Skill
### Why Web Accessibility is Important<sup>3<sup/>
The Web and Internet in whole is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of our life which includes: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is important that the Web be accessible to everyone in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities. An accessible Web can help people with disabilities participate more actively in society.

Also an accessible website is often the one of the easiest ways to do business with many people with disabilities, for instance, people who cannot read print material, people who have difficulty going to a physical store or mall, and others. Furthermore, what you do for accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile Web design, usability, and search engine optimization (SEO)
An accessible website gives the access to information and interaction for many people with disabilities. That is, the accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through Web technologies.

Another important consideration for organizations is that Web accessibility is required by laws and policies in some cases. WAI Web Accessibility Policy Resources links to resources for addressing legal and policy factors within organizations, including a list of relevant laws and policies around the world.

## Roles for Skill

## Work Related to Skill (Related Activities and Artifacts)
To make a web application accessible various activties involved are:

- Text Alternatives

Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.

- Time-based Media

Provide alternatives for time-based media.

- Adaptable

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.

- Distinguishable

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

- Keyboard Accessible

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

- Enough Time

Provide users enough time to read and use content.

- Seizures and Physical Reactions

Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.

- Seizures and Physical Reactions

Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.

- Input Modalities

Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.

- Readable

Make text content readable and understandable.

- Predictable

Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

- Input Assistance

Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

- Compatible

Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Real-World Example/Scenario of Skill (Text, Graphic, Audio, Video)

## Role of Academia or Industry in Cultivating the Skill

## Tools Supporting the Skill
### Functional Accessibility Evaluator 2.1

The Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE) evaluates a website or a single web page based on the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A and AA requirements.<sup>4<sup/>

- Evaluate multiple pages via web crawling
- Creates a Summary Report that identifies problem design features (e.g. rules) and pages
- Reports are saved in an Archived Reports list

## Skill Self-Assessment (My Skill Score (1 – 10) and Reasons for Self-Assigned Score)
3 

The reason for this skill score is because i have read about accesibilty before but have never tested it in any project. No academic or real world expereince with accessibilty testing is the reason for a score of 3. 

By the end of SESTOPIA i expect skill score to go around 8-9.
