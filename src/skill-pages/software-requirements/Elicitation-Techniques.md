## Classification of Skill
It requires both soft skill and technical skill by a business analyst to perform various elicitation techniques. The technical skill has more emphasis as it is a busniness analyst who is jotting the raw requirements in a well-organized and technical aspects as per the industry standards.

## Prerequisites for Skill

First step to start with elicitation techniques is requirement elicitation which is to obtain a comphrensive and accurate understanding of project’s business need. During elicitation process, one must possess strong understanding of business needs in order to select right set of stakeholders and elicitation techniques.

## Related Software Engineering Area(s)

 -  **Software Requirements-** “The Software Requirements knowledge area (KA) is concerned with the elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of software requirements as well as the management of requirements during the whole life cycle of the software product. A software requirement is a property that must be exhibited by something in order to solve some problem in the real world. An essential property of all software requirements is that they be verifiable as an individual feature as a functional requirement or at the system level as a nonfunctional requirement.”
 - **Software Design-** “Software design is the software engineering life cycle activity in which software requirements are analyzed in order to produce a description of the software’s internal structure that will serve as the basis for its construction.”
 -  **Software Testing-** "Software Testing is defined as an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results and to ensure that the software system is defect free. It involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. Software testing also helps to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements. It can be either done manually or using automated tools. Some prefer saying Software testing as a White Box Testing and Black Box Testing."
-   **Software Maintenance-** "Software Maintenance is the process of modifying a software product after it has been delivered to the customer. The main purpose of software maintenance is to modify and update software application after delivery to correct faults and to improve performance.
Need for Maintenance –
Software Maintenance must be performed in order to:
-   Correct faults.
-   Improve the design.
-   Implement enhancements.
-   Interface with other systems.
-   Accommodate programs so that different hardware, software, system features, and telecommunications facilities can be used.
-   Migrate legacy software.
-   Retire software."
    
-   **Software Configuration Management-** "Software Configuration Management(SCM) is a process to systematically manage, organize, and control the changes in the documents, codes, and other entities during the Software Development Life Cycle. The primary goal is to increase productivity with minimal mistakes. SCM is part of cross-disciplinary field of configuration management and it can accurately determine who made which revision."
    
-   **Software Engineering Management-** "Software engineering management can be defined as the application of management activities—planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting—to ensure that software products and software engineering services are delivered efficiently, effectively, and to the benefit of stakeholders."
    
-   **Software Engineering Process-** "Software processes are specified for a number of reasons: to facilitate human understanding, communication, and coordination; to aid management of software projects; to measure and improve the quality of software products in an efficient manner; to support process improvement; and to provide a basis for automated support of process execution."
    
-   **Software Engineering Models and Methods-** "Software engineering models and methods impose structure on software engineering with the goal of making that activity systematic, repeatable, and ultimately more success-oriented. Using models provides an approach to problem solving, a notation, and procedures for model construction and analysis. Methods provide an approach to the systematic specification, design, construction, test, and verification of the end-item software and associated work products."
    
-   **Software Quality-** "Quality software is reasonably bug or defect free, delivered on time and within budget, meets requirements and/or expectations, and is maintainable.
ISO 8402-1986 standard defines quality as “the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bears its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.”
Key aspects of quality for the customer include:
-   Good design – looks and style
-   Good functionality – it does the job well
-   Reliable – acceptable level of breakdowns or failure
-   Consistency
-   Durable – lasts as long as it should
-   Good after sales service
-   Value for money"

## Rationale for Skill-

This skill was chosen because it is the base to start with any project. Selecting right set of elicitation techniques is an important and major task which depends on the set of stakeholders of the project, there availability and location.

Each technique has its own importance and use, which makes it hard to select(yet important) the correct set of techiques while perform requirements elicitation. With a proper requirement elicitation, one can reduce major defects which might occur due to miscommunication or misunderstandings of the requirements. Choosing the right set of elicitation technique depends on various aspects like team size, stakeholders, duration of the project and many more aspects. For our team(small sized), Questionnaire technique was very beneficial to us as some requirements were unclear which got resolved by questioning towards various aspects of the project.

## Roles for Skill-
Typically, a requirement elicitation document is written by,
- Business Analyst
But, there can be others which might be responsible for writing the requirement specification like,
- Technical Architect
- Systems Architect
- Software developer along with the team


## Work Related to Skill (Related Activities and Artifacts)-

There are various techniques to perform elicitation-

-   **Brainstorming –** "The purpose of gathering your stakeholders for brainstorming is “to produce numerous new ideas, and to derive from them themes for further analysis [from BABOK].” An analyst should try to secure a representative from each participating stakeholder group in the brainstorming session. If an analyst serves as facilitator of a brainstorming session, she must ensure that while participants feel free to propose new ideas and solutions, they remain focused on the business need at hand and do not engage in scope creep, gold plating, or become distracted with other business issues. All ideas must be recorded so that they are not lost. According to BABOK, the brainstorming method is particularly useful if your project has no clear winning choice for a solution, or if existing proposed solutions are deemed inadequate. The brainstorming process and the resulting follow-up analysis will help ensure that the best possible solution is reached for any business objective."

  **Advantages of Brainstorming-**
  - It builds commitment
  - It brings involvement
  - It give enthusiasm
  - With brainstorming, we improve communication
  - We create cooperation and teamwork
  - It builds self-esteem
 
	  **Disadvantages of Brainstorming-**
  - Some irrelevant ideas may also be taken for evaluation
  - The might be idea overlap
  - Emotional or mental blocks might be possible lie fear of criticism
  
	  The following are the members of the brainstorming session:
1) Designer
2) Engineers
3) Executives
4) Marketing Experts
5) Psychology experts, and many more.

	
-   **Document analysis –** "Document analysis involves gathering and reviewing all existing documentation that is pertinent to your business objective or that may hold data related to a relevant solution. According to BABOK, such documentation may include, “business plans, market studies, contracts, requests for proposal, statements of work, memos, existing guidelines, procedures, training guides, competing product literature, published comparative product reviews, problem reports, customer suggestion logs, and existing system specifications, among others.” In other words, virtually anything that is written related to the project may be useful. This type of elicitation is especially useful when the goal is to update an existing system or when the understanding of an existing system will enhance a new system. However, document analysis alone is rarely enough to thoroughly extract all of the requirements for any given project."

    **Advantages of Data Analysis-**
    - Inexpesive and economical
    - Saves time and effort for later tasks
    - Useful for hypothesis

	**Disagvantages of Data Analysis-**
There are not all that numerous impediments as they are expected worries to know about before picking the strategy or when utilizing it. An underlying worry to consider is that documents are not made with information research goals and subsequently require some insightful abilities.

-   **Focus Group –** "Focus groups consist of a mix of pre-qualified stakeholders who gather to offer input on the business need at hand and its potential solutions. Focus groups are particularly helpful when key stakeholders are not particularly imaginative or forthcoming; a few more vocal stakeholders may help them think through and articulate solutions. Focus groups are also a good way for time-pressed analysts to get a lot of information at once. They may be conducted in person or virtually. (Key project sponsors or business owners should still be interviewed individually for thorough discovery.)"

    **Advantages of Focus Group-**
    - Easy to observe customer reaction
    - Time saving opportunity as we can get the responses right away rather doing the tedious interviews.
    
    **Disadvantages of Focus Group-**
    - Not as indepth as other research strategies
    - Expensive to be executed
    - Moderator bias
   
-   **Interface Analysis –** "An interface analysis carefully analyzes and deconstructs the way that a user interacts with an application, or the way one application interacts with another. According to BABOK, a thorough interface analysis will describe the purpose of each interface involved and elicit high-level details about it, including outlining its content. This type of elicitation is essential for software solutions, which almost always involve applications interacting with one another and/or users interacting with applications. But, according to BABOK, interface analysis can also be useful for non-software solutions (such as defining deliverables by third parties)."

    **Advantages of Interface Analysis-**
    - More accurate project planning is possible
    - Saves time and cost
    - Easy to collaborate with other projects and systems
   
    **Disadvantage of Interface Analysis-**
    It doesn't provide understanding of the underlying business process.
    
-   **Interviews –** "One-on-one interviews are among the most popular types of requirements elicitation, and for good reason: they give an analyst the opportunity to discuss in-depth a stakeholder’s thoughts and get his or her perspective on the business need and the feasibility of potential solutions. “Interviews are the most effective way of eliciting requirements.” Whether an analyst chooses to have a structured (with predefined questions) or unstructured interview (with free-flowing, back-and-forth conversation), she must fully understand the business need in order to conduct a successful interview. It is a good practice for an analyst to share her interview notes with the interviewee afterward to ensure there were no misunderstandings and to jog the interviewee’s thoughts for any further insights."
It can be of two types-
	-   **Structured interview**: In structured interview
	    -   Design open and close ended questions
	    -   Defines a logical flow of the questions
	-   **Unstructured interview**: In unstructured interview
	    -   Determine the areas to be covered in the interview
	    -   Determine the progression of the interview

    **Advantages of  Interviews-**
    - Accurate screening
    - Capture verbal and non-verbal questions
    - Captures emotions and behaviors
    
    **Disadvantages of Interviews-**
    - Cost inefficient
    - Quality of data by interviewer
    - Manual data entry
    
-   **Observation (job shadowing) –** "Observation is quite helpful when considering a project that will change or enhance current processes. According to BABOK, two basic types of observation are available to an analyst: (1) passive observation, where the analyst merely watches someone working but does not interrupt or engage the worker in any way, and (2) active observation, where an analyst asks questions throughout the process to be sure she understands and even attempts portions of the work. The nature of an analyst’s project will dictate the level of detail an observation should encompass. As with interviews, it is a good practice for an analyst to provide notes from her observations and/or a verbal description of her understanding of the work for the worker to review in order to be sure that there were no misunderstandings of the process."

    **Advantages of Observation-**
    - Simple technique
    - Useful for hypothesis framing
    - Great accuracy
    
    **Disadvantages of Observation-**
    - Some occurances might not be open to observations
    - Lack of Reliability
    - Faulty perception
    - Slow investigation
    - Personal bias of the observer
    - Expensive
    
-   **Prototyping (storyboarding, navigation flow, paper prototyping, screen flows) –** "Prototyping is especially valuable for stakeholders such as business owners and end users who may not understand all of the technical aspects of requirements, but will better relate to a visual representation of the end product. To quote BABOK, “Stakeholders often find prototyping to be a concrete means of identifying, describing and validating their interface needs.” The prototyping process is normally iterative, improving as more input and evaluation are gleaned from stakeholders. Prototyping may be an interactive screen (normally consisting of hypertext only with no real data behind it), a mock-up (such as a PowerPoint), a navigation flow (such as a Visio diagram), or a storyboard. Simple, throwaway prototypes (such as pencil sketches) may be done in the initial stages of discovery, and more detailed, interactive prototypes may be done once business requirements have been identified. At the latter, more detailed prototype stage,prototype features must fulfill previously identified business needs as outlined in the requirements."

    **Advantages of Prototyping-**
    - Reduced time and costs
    - Improved and increased user involvement
    
    **Disadvantages of Prototyping-**
    - Insufficient analysis
    - User confusion
    - Developer misunderstanding of user objectives
    - Excessive Development Time
    
-   **Requirements workshops –** "A requirements workshop involves gathering a previously identified stakeholders in a structured setting for a defined amount of time in order to elicit, refine, and/or edit requirements. To be successful, requirements workshops must include a recorder (or scribe) to record participants’ input, and a facilitator to direct the discussion. Because participants’ may also brainstorm together and listen to each others’ input, they can provide immediate feedback and refinements to identified business needs, which can ensure a fast, effective elicitation of requirements."

    **Advantages of requirements workshops-**
    -  Clients are typically propelled 
    - Have adaptability over length and recurrence of meetings 
    - Can offer a progression of workshops that expand on each other 
    
    **Disadvantages of requirements workshops-**
    - Clients going to may have a wide scope of abilities (PC and language)
    - May experience issues getting a room if study hall space is hard to find.
    - May be difficult to fit everything that you need to cover into a solitary workshop.

Taking care of enormous classes for hands-on training might be troublesome.
-   **Survey/questionnaire –** "While they preclude the opportunity for in-person, ad hoc conversations, surveys are useful for quickly gathering data from a large group of participants. Because free online survey software is readily available, surveys are an inexpensive way to gather objective input from customers or potential end users. As with selecting stakeholders, a successful survey or questionnaire must have well-chosen participants. As one researcher notes, questionnaires “can be useful when the population is large enough, and the issues addressed are clear enough to all concerned.” Surveys can be structured to offer a series of finite choices for feedback, or they can offer open-ended input, depending on the needs of the project at hand. Open-ended surveys are useful for a broader discovery of business needs; however, the larger the number of participants in open-ended surveys, the more prohibitive they are to analyze. Survey wording must be unambiguous and precise. It is good practice for an analyst to politely request that survey participants respond by a reasonable deadline and that they keep any proprietary business information contained within the survey confidential."

**Advantages of survey/ questionnaire-**
- Inexpensive
- Practical
- Fast Results
- Scalable
- Comparable
- Easy Analysis
- Validity & Reliability
- Low pressure
- Standardized
**Disadvantages of survey/ questionnaire-**
- Dishonest answers
- Skipped questions
- Interpretation issues
- Lack of Nuance
- Analysis issues
- Hidden agendas
- Lack of personalization
- Accessibility issues
- Survey fatigue

At last, business analysis is utilized to perceive and articulate the requirement for change in how organizations work, and to advance that alteration. As business analysts, we recognize and characterize the arrangements that will augment the worth conveyed by an organization to its stakeholders.
