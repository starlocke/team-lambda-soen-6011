            <em>SESTOPIA</em> is an information-intensive web application
            showcasing software engineering skills
            from the 15 different knowledge areas of the SWEBOK which 
            stands for “Software Engineering Body of Knowledge”.
            SES for Software Engineering Skills, combined with Utopia, gives the portmanteau
            name: SESTOPIA.
            Each team member has chosen a unique knowledge area and 
            has written an article that explains, at length, certain important aspects of
            a skill that they are passionate about.
