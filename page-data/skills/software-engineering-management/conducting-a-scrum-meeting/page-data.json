first step towards an effective Scrum meeting is making sure that the meeting stays on target. In order to do this, the only subjects that should come up during this time are what each individual team member is working on as well as the issues they’re struggling with.</li>\n<li><strong>Meetings should not be about problem-solving</strong><br>\nOne important thing to note is that for the daily Scrum meetings to be effective, problems can’t be solved during the meetings. While the third question brings issues to the forefront, these issues may not affect the whole team. As a result, spending an excessive amount of time discussing these issues with everyone is not a productive use of team time.</li>\n<li><strong>Team members should be prepared ahead of time</strong><br>\nAs mentioned in the discussion of the three questions, your team members should be able to answer those questions without your prompting. In order for this to happen, you must outline what you expect to hear from your team every day. Once you set those expectations, your team members should come prepared with answers on a daily basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Make the meetings short</strong><br>\nDaily Scrums that run too long aren’t effective. People get distracted, stop listening, and ramble on for far too long. Your team then begins to resent these meetings, and communication breaks down. That’s why limiting your meeting time is so important. The shorter they are, the more likely people are to pay attention and find them necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Stand Up Meetings</strong><br>\nSome believe that, by forcing everyone to stand during the daily Scrum meeting, the meeting is more likely to stay on target and on time. And let’s be honest, the reasoning is solid. No one wants to stand around for an hour just talking.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure the meetings are daily</strong><br>\nWhen you’re running daily Scrum meetings, make sure that they’re just that – daily. This is important for consistent communication between team members about what is and isn’t being accomplished.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"roles-for-skill\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#roles-for-skill\" aria-label=\"roles for skill permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Roles for Skill</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: The person with the product vision</li>\n<li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: The scrum expert who helps the team build the product according to the scrum framework</li>\n<li><strong>Development Team</strong>: The team members who execute the work</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"work-related-to-skill-related-activities-and-artifacts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#work-related-to-skill-related-activities-and-artifacts\" aria-label=\"work related to skill related activities and artifacts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Work Related to Skill (Related Activities and Artifacts)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scrum Master</strong><br>\nA scrum master is a facilitator for an Agile development team; they are responsible for managing the exchange of information between team members.

Higher quality is built through early testing. Scrum enables early, high-quality release to market. Sounds like a good fit for scrum. This reality is why plenty of manufacturers now employ scrum masters and agile coaches.<br>\nNew technologies are astounding: robotics, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing, and nanotechnology, to name but a few. Each of these technologies introduces new complexities to production. Scrum- and agile-based frameworks are ideal for problem-solving complexity.  </li>\n<li><strong>Shareholder value</strong><br>\nScrum and its organic feedback cycle emphasize regular customer-value feedback. After each sprint, you have working, shippable product to show to stakeholders and customers. Even if you can’t get feedback during the sprint, scrum allows you to adapt as soon as you receive the feedback.<br>\nAs stated in the Agile Manifesto, the primary measure of success is a working product in the hands of a customer — the earlier the better, and the more frequently the better. Scrum does both.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic capacity management</strong><br>\nIn building tangible products, you may not have a final piece of product to place in someone’s hands at the end of a one-week sprint. This is fine. Just remember to keep the progression demonstrable and the feedback cycle as short as possible.<br>\nThe idea is to have regular, frequent feedback from users. The specifics will vary with each product. Work to keep the feedback cycle as short as possible and decrease it when possible.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"tools-supporting-the-skill\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tools-supporting-the-skill\" aria-label=\"tools supporting the skill permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tools Supporting the Skill</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>monday.com</strong><br>\nmonday.com is great for managing scrum teams and projects.
