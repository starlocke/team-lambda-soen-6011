Put another way, given that each project is unique, it is necessary to have\nindividuals providing the lower-level services of either manually doing all of the\nconfiguration management, or, finding clever ways to automate as much of those tasks\nas possible.</p>\n<p>It takes a lot more detailed knowledge and enough experience in order to tailor\nsolutions out of the rough guidelines of what goes into an automated software configuration\nmanagement system, let alone a manually operated one.</p>\n<p>The basis for acquiring the first degree of experience would be a personal drive\n(whether internally realized or externally mandated) to solve complex problems,\nespecially along multiple dimensions of concern as shall be discussed later. The\nbasis to remain employed in software configuration management would be consistently\ndelivering positive results by solving a practically never-ending series of challenges\nneeding solutions.</p>\n<p>An illustrative example of this would be about \"time\". Suppose there is a relatively\nsimple software project involving client-server communications secured using\nan algorithm that incorporates the current time (+/- some margin) for security. Initially, an\nautomated software configuration management system works brilliantly. Then,\nsuddenly, all of its alerts fire off. The culprit? The clocks between the systems\nunder test have been drifting apart slowly until the day the \"surprise bomb\"\ncauses chaos in an otherwise perfectly functioning system. Without having ever\nseen or heard about \"clock drift\" interference before, it would take some\ntenacious problem solving skill to discern the root cause of the issue and\nresolve it. An overview of more clock issues is provided by Marco Platania's\n\"<a href=\"http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/~platania/index_files/clock_sync.pdf\">Clock Synchronization</a>\"\npresentation.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are also many problems in SCM that operate on multiple facets\nand concerns. For instance, making trade-offs between \"perfect\" and \"good enough\"\nsolutions in order to meet various pressures like contracted delivery dates,\neconomics, societal expectations, best practices, professionalism, etc.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, essentially the constant need to get some grasp on the \"big\npicture\" (ex: communications are secure) of the project while concurrently solving many\n\"small detail\" issues (ex: clocks are synchronized), this skill is marked 10 out\nof 10 as a conceptual skill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"foundations-people-skills\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#foundations-people-skills\" aria-label=\"foundations people skills permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Foundations: People Skills</h3>\n<p>In performing the skill automating software configuration management systems,\nthere is fundamentally always a give-and-take negotiation between indivuals requesting\nfilling up the \"problems\" stack, and those chipping away at that with \"solutions\".\nBeing on the \"solution\" side of the equation, it is of the utmost importance\nfor a practioner of SCM automation to be mindful of the <em>expectations</em> being\nset. SCM has been highlighted as crucial to the success of systems and software\nengineering projects. Consequently, an SCM automation practioner will certainly\nbe center stage when things go positively or negatively. To chart a respectable\ncourse and continuously build positive relationships no matter the results would\nrequire a fairly significant amount of negotation know-how.</p>\n<p>Negotiation is just one soft skill required, among many others, for success in\nSCM automation. There is a lot of human relationship management required when in\na role focused automating SCM.</p>\n<p>Because of its critically to a team often consisting of many different specialists\nhaving many different concerns, the practioner of automating software configuration\nmanagement really needs a high degree of people human relation skills, getting\nit an 8 out of 10 score in that domain. A fairly high order because of its\npotential impact if relationships are soured, but, not maxxed out because most\nof the active working time is spent \"in the trenches\" performing software development\ntowards making the automations a reality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"specialities-software-development-skill\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#specialities-software-development-skill\" aria-label=\"specialities software development skill permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Specialities: Software Development Skill</h3>\n<p>The automation of software configuration management is essentially a form of meta-project\nthat supports the primary project.

That is because teams are often formed with members having somewhat\ndisjoint skills and specialities and it is rare to have members who are experts\nin literally all aspects of sufficiently complex projects. Every member of such\na team may have a very limited idea of what the whole project entails, but they\neach might also have extremely detailed understanding of aspects of the project\nthat they are individually specializing in. By committing all of the concerns\nfrom each team member into automation systems, the whole team benefits and is\nmore efficient overall.</p>\n<p>It is possible to view the whole of automating SCM pipelines as working to solve\nissues along 3 orthogonal dimensions: versions, platforms, scale. In versioning,\nthe concern is with changes over time. In platforming, the concern is with being\nable to make use of the same software on computer systems having differing\nfoundations (for example: ARM vs x86 architectures; macOS vs Windows).

It is entirely possible\nthat there is overlap between \"the platform\" and \"the product\".</p>\n<p>Example</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are developing a mobile game for the iPhone X or newer, leverage those models'\n3D facial-recognition cameras.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Example</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are developing a point-of-sale, credit-card reader application for iPhones\nand iPads newer than 2015; we can sell the app, the card-reader and the\nphones/tablets together as bundles to business looking for turn-key solutions.\nFor security reasons, they must be operating on iOS version 9 or newer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Example</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are developing a cross-platform ebook application that can run on\nmultiple different computers (ARM, x86, etc) and operating systems (macOS,\nWindows, Linux, Android, iOS, etc).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Traditionally, it would be incumbent on dedicated IT personnel to administer\nthe physical and logical platforms on which software would run. In many situations,\nthat is still in fact the case due to constraints about accessing modern solutions\nand resources. In many of those situations where software projects are produced\nwith limited resources, those charged with handling the SCM for the project would\nbecome the de-facto, informal leadership and may fill in the gap left by IT. IT\ndepartments are frequently found to be uninterested in project-specific issues.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, SCM experts embedded in software project teams would be called upon\nto provision platform-as-a-service to the primary software development members of\nthe projects. On the classical end of the spectrum, a set of hands-on computing\nresources would need to be managed en-mass in automated fashion. On the modern end\nof the spectrum, it could be a set of in-the-cloud computing resources. Naturally,\nhybrid solutions are viable, too.</p>\n<p>At the bare minimum, one specific platform needs to be consistently targetted\nthroughout the software development lifecycle (example: the Mars Rover Curiosity).\nThere also exist situations where a vast array of different specific platforms\nmust be targeted (example: a cross-platform, mass-market application).</p>\n<p>When automating SCM, there is a need to become familar with handling all sorts\nof different hardware and software configurations in a disciplined, planned,\nrigorous manner such that building, running and testing of the software product\nwould be reliable and reproducible over the lifetime of the project. The goal\nof automating the software configuration management of platforms is to alieviate\nthe operation of intensely tedious mappings and remappings of platform-specific\nnuances, leaving developers to focus primarily on their software development\ninstead of platform-specific issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scm-of-scale\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#scm-of-scale\" aria-label=\"scm of scale permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>SCM of Scale</h3>\n<p>When the nature of a sofware project is such that the development team must also\noperate the software, then, the software configuration management of scale becomes\na particularly interesting affair.

They commonly provide the essential solution for keep track of history\nand multiple versions of a software project. In formal projects, it is of the\nutmost importance to be able to store the project's history, share that amongst\ncollaborators, and be able to work on any particular commit as a starting\npoint. The automated computer systems that operate in continuous integration\nand continuous deployment rely on code repositories as a source of truth.</p>\n<p>A sampling of commonly employed repository software follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arguably the finest repository system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mercurial-scm.org/\">Mercurial</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>May be an alternative to Git.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.perforce.com/\">Perforce</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Has a claim to fame in handling \"binary\" files.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://subversion.apache.org/\">Subversion (SVN)</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arguably one of the worst repository systems.
